"What do YOU think to the current state of Foldable phones?
To check out that Tesla Electro Phone video: https://youtu.be/uPxkrGL0l7U",1
"Well, finally someone who can compete with Samsung on this market. Competition is always good, hope Samsung will now realize they're not the only one and speed up the innovation in foldables",1
"I wanna see them attempt something like the Z-Flip because it's something I can imagine myself actually using compared to the fold
And this already looks promising",1
"4:57 ""And then actually coming with the charger to do that with"" Respect +100 for Xiaomi for not getting in on the no charger included scam.",0
"Personally, for me this was one of, if not the best video you've ever made. You were so simple but always on point. The green environment helped a lot as a background, and the lighting was exceptionally good(plus, your puns were better this time)",1
"On the subject of display inefficiency: I wonder if, especially on a clamshell, a folding phone could use an e-ink display - not sufficient for full usage, but for a smaller screen that's pretending to be a smart watch 90% of the time, it might be able to do the trick.",1
"Yeah the Xiaomi looks alot nicer. Theres a few aesthetic things i like better on the Samsung but fhe form factor being alot thinner, folding flat, and looking like a normal phone when folded. Now if Samsung did all these things they would have a perfect foldable device. Great video as always Arun! 👍🏻❤️",1
"Since it is Xiaomi's second fold phone and Samsung has released their 4th, it seems that Xiaomi is doing pretty well, considering that they did start 2 years late. If given enough time, both companies could make outstanding foldables.",1
"This guy here does the most objective and informative reviews on tech YouTube and that is why I like this channel. Everything seems natural and unforced and I never skip parts. No subjective bias, no aggressive marketing towards paid sponsorships and no controversy. Keep up the good work man 😁",1
"Foldables aren't quite there for me yet, but always tempting. This is a good step forward to me, cannot stand the AR on the front screen of the Samsung and that alone makes it a total non-starter for me.",1
"I'm not a fan of folding phones because of the plastic screen, but they do look mighty interesting! It might be gimmicky, but I had a flip phone when those were all the rage, so something in my lizard brain is always drawn to them.",0
"Xiaomis weakness has always been software. They always had great cameras, build quality and specs.
I wish they move on to a more purer version of Android or atleast launch a separate line of phones which don't run on MIUI, like they did with the android one program a few years back.",1
I can’t wait for the next Z-Fold. I can only imagine what technological upgrades they have in store,1
Even though I'm not a Xiaomi fan this phone looks sick. The first foldable phone that seems like something I'd actually want. There's just one question remaining - how good it is in terms of reliability. There has been some major problems with Samsung's foldable screens already I wonder how did they manage solve cracking issues.,0
"So basically what Xiaomi did is try to add/remove what Samsung added/removed without actually taking into consideration the consequences of adding/removing such a thing. Look at the hinge for example, they made is smaller in exchange for it being sturdier and more protected. Overall I think Samsung has more experience when it comes to building a folding phone",0
"Watching this on my Z Fold 4. I absolutely love it, I could definitely say that now it's the time to turn into foldable phones. The different ways to take pictures, the image quality on both screens, the so practical Taskbar for multitasking. By the way, I found really useful multitask on the main screen. The only weak point I have experienced is the battery life, as on every Samsung phone (except for the S7 Edge). Fold 4 is quite expensive though, but I'm taking advantage of every single feature on it.

Thanks for this honest review, man. Greetings from Mexico 🇲🇽",1
Finally someone who has come out and said what the real shortfalls are. Especially with apps not being able to make full use of the screen.,0
"i am not a foldable fan but am excited for the rollable form factor coz that seems much more useful than a foldable like that oppo concept
if that catches on we could have a full size tablet rolled up to a normal size phone in some years",1
This is a really nice fold!! Now this is a foldable phone I'd actually want to use!!,1
"With all the drawbacks/sacrifice xiaomi had to make for this phone, I do think it is by far the most practical foldable phone in the world. It’s thin enough so I can really use it like a normal phone most of the time, and use it like a tablet when I need to. 
Maybe it’s just me but I’m all in for the no puncture/notch full display on the inside. Video call with the main camera is pretty ok.",0

It's great that you put so much effort to provide the information and i guess that's why  we all love to watch your channel content ❤️❤️👍👍,1

I have an idea why can’t somebody develop a snapon touchscreen pad like ipad … in which we can hop on our phone like a puzzle to use the bigger screen,1
You have made me realise how terrible fold is,0
Can you look for aphone called Tecno camon please,1
Mate x was the most efficient foldable,1
That video was very captivating This is why you are my favourite youtuber,1
Foldable Phones are slowly but surely getting better and better.,1

Seems you're always much excited to make a review about a Chinese brand and who sponsored ur video it was much better if you could make a review on Galaxy Z fold 4 which launch millions of years before then this XIAOMI ...bitter reality,1
I'll love for you to teach me your Amazing Editing skills,1

These are just foldable tablets.,1
"Personally I do like Foldables, and I kinda wanna try one. But I do feel that if you are more of a casual phone user that foldables aren't worth it yet, because of the plastic screen, the bump in the screen, and the prices. 
But I do think after they get cheaper they will be more worth it, and with dbrand making Grips for the Samsung Fold phones it makes durability less scary than it was before, and I kinda wanna try one.",1

"Wow.. what a phone🤩❤️🤩❤️
Let more foldables be launched so that it prevents monopoly. And Samsung will make better designs and reduce the price.

I own a S22 Ultra and I'm a Samsung fan since many years..!

Needs a stylus built in then it'd be worth it.,1
I'd rather have a flip. Women's pockets are small on most clothes. It would not stick out as much as it does with my a53. But I'm too cheap to shill out the $.,0
I got an ad of you when I clicked the video 💀,0
One mistake in 1:46. Cause you are one of the biggest smartphone tech youtuber and you can’t make silly mistakes like that burhh,1

@mrwhosetheboss when did you film this as i recently went where you did and am  wondering if we were there at the same time,0
Better u could include huawei mate xs into this comparison! Huawei also make beautiful phone designs,1
"Hopefully the next gen of MIX Fold is have a feature Arun says like built in Selfie, maybe the flex mode and how the apps use the screen fully. @FrankieTech",1
Watch it,1
When you first aploded it,1
"I'm better than Mrwhosetheboss, My content is better!",1
"I don't think foldables are here to stay. There are many other concepts that, with time, will make so much more sense.",1
I bought this phone love it it’s stunning makes the Samsung look like a tractor in comparison but Samsung is far ahead in the software department. I think and hope  mix fold 2 will get better more optimised software. One annoying thing about is when you change from outside screen to inside it must restart the app.,1

Hello,1
 @Parrolet  🙂🙂🙂,1
"You made a great video as usual but this honestly feels like 3d tv. It’s basically just a gimmick.

Wouldn’t it be cheaper just to get the android phone you want, and buy an android tablet to use on the few occasions you would need a bigger screen?

The amount of people that would actually require a bigger screen must be pretty small compared to everyone else right?",1
Glad they are trying.,1
"i miss your comparison videos, pls compare the latest samsung, xiaomi and huawei foldables plssssss",0
"No matter is it thin or not but Samsung is always the winner. This is bcz their durability is much authentic than the Xiomi. Now you guys are thinking it as stylish but you won't buy this phone anyway bcz you’d what if xiomi fall from hand and the 10% less pricy phone would then make you pay 2o% more!

Stop goin to these chinise, and yea if want thin really and big screen so go to powerhouse Tab s8 ultra or S22 ultra no other phone can defeat this device, not even our irony Apple compared to it's os, and desk top mode and some feature will blow your heart, and there are some lacks. However, the issue doesn't go towards Samsung but goes for Android os and to Google.",0
Im short,0
 @Majk olsson  LOL,1
Huawei foldables are best no Criss and very good cameras but they are way to expensive. Samsung is to thic Criss to big overall had experience. Xiaomi has ok price is thin and Criss is good enough but as with every Xiaomi phone softver kills it for me,0

"They are def getting better for sure . BUT ! I was a dedicated Xiaomi user for the last 6 - 7 years and have swapped both phone and tablet too Samsung as i dont want to risk having a Chinese Phone and Tablet that might get bricked or spied on if China ever dropped the ball and ""invaded"" Taiwan .

Im gonna skip all Foldable phone until reviewers  said something good about the phone on the next generation. That's whar technology is all about.,1

"samsung and huawei are losing the foldable race that they have created.
Oppo is first place.",0
Imagine being able to use a flip phone to casually record 360 footage since it would have 2 camera modules facing opposite directions. I think that would be pretty cool. Might possibly be a thing but more likely to be a fun gimmick that wouldnt get used.,1
After watching this and watching a durably test on the z fold 4 I don’t think it would hold up to the same punishment,0
Does it support USA network bands?,1
"Random question, what aspect ratio are you filming this in, I notice that on a 16:9 display, you manage to keep the video progress bar just barely below the content itself when in fullscreen, and it is really nice not having it block content!",1

"Another tremendously well done review made into a tremendously well made video, MrWhose!",1
I'm really getting tired about you complaining about the aspect ratio! What's the point buying a fold if a smartphone has a larger screen when watching a movie?,0
" @sanju baba  that seems like a bit a nonsensical thought. he isn't even praising the form factor AS IS independent from who made the foldable. that already takes away more and is more critical than anything any OEM would want to pay for. also, why wouldn't a reviewer praise those aspects of a product that he or she likes, regardless of who made it? and  if a Chinese maker comes with something good or even great, wouldn't the reviewer praise them BE CAUSE they are Chinese? 
(PS also I wonder if Chinese money is worth a lot outside of their own country. I have never heard of anyone being paid in their currency.)",1
I hope you see my comments idol your may top one idol in tech vlog i hope you help me i have struggled in online class her in Philippines because of lack of gadget to attend online class i pray to god that you help me plss 😇🥺,0

Only china is not a compitition for now per se but apart from the lack of front camera it's all good.,0
But people are buying samsung folds than xiaomi remember even samsung folds are expensive than xiaomi,0
"​ @DEADinside RF  Samsung are more expensive, that's why people buy because they think higher price equals to good quality.",1
 @Shiro  aren`t they more expensive coz they got more features ??!!,0
that xiaomi's foldable phone is not as durable as samsung fold 4 .....looks way more cheaper......it is less durable......it is not even water proof......it doesnt have a proper software for foldable phone...like samsung has........it doesnt even support any stylus......and plus its ui is the worst.........AND THE CONCLUTION IS THAT SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD 4 IS BEST PERFECT AND PROPER FOLDABLE PHONE,0
 @Mako K  yes they are.,1
 @Kholi Mao  too bad they don't sell it in the US,0
 @video clips  Samsung user right here. And no lol Xiaomi foldable phone is just better get over it 😁😁😁😁,1
 @Shiro no samsung is more quality than xiaomi,0
 @Shiro  Samsung foldables is higher quality with dust and water resistance.,1
"Meanwhile Apple FOLDABLE iPhone will launch on 2025 and says: ""Hey, we're have a NEW FOLDABLE iPhone that's very Innovative & Futuristic...""

Android User eating popcorn & in aw state. What da heck Apple? Y u not following the technology like them???

(No offense, i've both iPhone & Android phone using it until now)",1
" @video clips  
Ngl, the use of caps and periods in this comment disturb me, but the general message I can get on board with, that’s assuming you’re not just heavily biased towards the fold 4.",1
" @video clips  Z fold isn't perfect, for example it doesn't fold flat.

I do agree that the Xiaomi isn't really competing well, the device lacks plenty of features we've come to expect from foldables (all thanks to Samsung). So why spend less when you're already spending more than a flagship you might as well put in a bit more money to gain a better experience?",1
 @Good Side  Seems like you don't really know the full capabilities of Samsung foldables.,1
"Well it's good, so now samsung have competitor on folding phone so they can be more creative on the design. Pretty dissapoint with the current fold 4, nothing different from last year fold. The small display is unusable, feel like you dont want to do anything with the small screen. 
Hope samsung will bring a complitely new thing on next year fold",1
Samsung knows before that the inner and outer screen of xiaomi fold 2 manufacturered by samsung display,1
" @video clips  what is wrong with you? It's meant to be an affordable fold, it doesn't need anyone of those features, and no phone will survive a bad fall regardless of durability unless it's one of those rugged phones, it does have stylus support, the miui fold os is still very new",0
"I don't know how many Xiaomi Samsung killers he's featured on his channel, but I'm sure he could make a playlost with them. I prefer to keep away from Chinese tech for now.",1
" @Shiro  Hold both phones in ur hands and you would know Samsung is a better quality phone. The way Fold 4 feels in your hands, the way its hinge functions, etc are all magnificent.",1
"I'm better than Mrwhosetheboss, My content is better!",1
Oppo is a good contender but that's china only too.,1
Huawei tried it once or twice,1
 @video clips  you could have just used commas like a functional member of society,1
" @Shiro  and he literally states in the video that in almost every way the fold is better quality. from its build to its software, xiaomi still has a lot of catching up to do",1
 @Instagram User  No one is better than this YouTuber...,0

Have you ever heard the name of Huawei.?,1
if only huawei still has google services.,0
" @ryan lausa  yes, if you can’t beat then kill it. Sarcasm*",1
" @Adil Khan  huawei phones are good if not better than samsung. in my own opinion, though.",1
"They can't though at least not on a global scale. Since xiaomi won't work in the U.S, Canada, or other UK markets where the lions share of mobile devices are sold. I really really with they would though, we do need some serious global competition for apple and Samsung. Cus as it stands if you want an android your choices from carriers are a pixel, iphone, or galaxy. Even the unlocked market adds Blu phones (which suck) a small sprinkling of Motorola phones (the good ones never make it to the US anyway) or Sony. That's about it and both Motorola and Sony phones have such a low market share % they really aren't even contenders",0
Sometimes it seems that people forget that the Motorola Razr exists 🤔,0
I really hope this goes global. The Z fold 4 feels stagnated and its obviously because there's barely competition so not much reason to innovate.,0
"Look at all the people jumping in to defend Samsung, lol. Nobody is saying Xiaomi is better than Samsung, not even Arun. All that was said is this is a competitor, and for a few features, it does beat Samsung. And competition is generally a good thing that helps push improvements. Not sure why people are jumping in to hammer the competitor. The better Xiaomi does, which they are doing, the more Samsung have to improve, and users benefit",1
My fault wauwi however u spell it,0
 @Mohammad Ismail  both does bruh,1
" @Good Side  Stop fanboying to both of you, competition only helps the consumer.",1
 @Shiro  You can't compare a xiaomi to a samsung yet... in almost every single department... especially software. People don't buy folds today for 10 min faster charging or 15 minute more battery life... you can just go get a flagship for the best specs.,1
But i will prefer Samsung.,1
 @DEADinside RF  most of china's foldable are not sold internationally.,0
"Well samsung's fold have better software optimization including 4 years of os updates and 5 years security updates, and the dynamic amoled screen still the beat display in smartphones ,build quality and features plus the IPX8 rating.",1
" @Damien Lee  no it's not better... the software optimizations, build quality, dynamic amoled, features and IPX8 rating of samsung can't be beat by xiaomi's fold in reality.",1
 @Good Side  Xiaomi's only advantage is being thinner and having a wider outer display. Samsung Fold 4 does better in everything else.,0
" @video clips  doesn't have a proper foldable software? It's the Chinese release of this phone it's optimized for Chinese 3rd party apps and it's 1st party software, when the international one happens they should have thier software working on American 3rd party apps",0
" @Arash Mojtahedi  yes, all smartphone displays are",1
"unfortunately for this phone to be a contender, it would have to pull back on some of the things it has. Because all it feels like now is that if, Samsung were to spread the phone out a bit, they would still be leading. which they still are leading. Being so thin is making it cut corners on sound, cameras, wireless charging, water/dust proof, etc.",0
" @Good Side  lol aside from claiming that samsung fold 4 is best, what videoclips is telling are on point, as of now fold 4 are better on those categories. In short, fold 4 right now is the reliable foldable phone that unfold into bigger screen in the market. The only issue with fold 4 are thickness and the front screen is not that wide. The software and the use of apps in fold is better than xiaomi, the cameras and durability.",1
 @Rabbi4skin  Again with the conspiracy theorists.,1
Xiaomi nailed it regardless.,1
" @Rabbi4skin I am just going to use the kyrkazart In a nutshell conspiracy trst. Do billionaires and normal people have opinions, yes so he is not getting paid",1
? but why copying Samsung? not very creative,0
" @Shiro  thats because Korean phones >> Chinese phones...Xiaomi phones have poor build quality and don't last...I've seen people with the original Samsung folds still going strong, but I've had a few Chinese phones that give up after a year or 2.",0
"Huawei would have nailed this market had they not been banned. In the android smartphone industry, it was always Huawei who made those innovations mainstream & worthwhile. On software front, they were also ahead of Samsung. There were so many useful features that no other Android UI had. 
Too bad they got banned & the largest smartphone competitor was ousted on something that all tech firms are guilty of. No other Chinese company will ever come this close to making Apple & Samsung get on their toes as Huawei did.",0
Why? Forget brand loyalty and always get the best option that's available to what you want. You don't need to wait for Samsung or any other company.,1
Well Xiaomi phones arent really a thing over here in the states...so Samsung is STILL by itself over here,0
:D,1
Samsung still does it better no matter what and it's only gonna get better,1
 @video clips  did you even hear what he said in the video,1
No-one tell him that Oppo exists.,0
 @sirfer6969  That's why they're cheaper. The first few years the performance is exactly kinda same. Not all peoples are rich like you.,1
Samsung hasn't made the best foldable when you think about it. Huawei had the better foldable of the previous generation but then the company got blacklisted for whatever reason...  I wonder if the same thing is going to happen to xiaomi,0
 @video clips  i agree,1
 @Good Side  your opinion,1
 @Damien Lee  its because people have opinions and you think Xiaomi is better so ye,1
 @Mako K  lmao nope. Look at Apple.,1
 @Troll  I didn't say more expensive stuff have more features. Just said the Samsung folds are more expensive since they have more features,0
"Innovations take time just like how inventions take time, if you want things to speed up then clearly quality will be compromised and since China is already ahead of entire globe in terms of less cost of any electronic component then it will become very easy for Xiaomi to win over samsung, don't forget that samsung don't use china services, chinese components after 2019 so even if it tried to make best product with superb components in it even then they would have to raise the price of the price to recover their cost and then make profit, which will again give win to Xiaomi for making alternative phone with better features at very less price and with charger in the box",1
China gov will enjoy watching your daily routines and special occasions. Haha.,1
 @Shiro  no ppl buy samsung because its global.....nobody wants to buy a chinese brand phone because you have to find who will give you service for the phone,0
 @Good Side  if ite not waterproof i dont want it lol,0
 @Damien Lee  theres lots of ppl in the comments saying xaomi is better lmao....looks like youre defending them haha,1
 @Good Side  hahaha...it is weaker and cheaper....🤣,1
 @Haru Yanto  no one needs foldable????ha......in a buissines use fold 4 is useful a Lott!!,1

xiaomi is not a competitor - the hinge is flimsy and their software is garbage,0
 @Shiro  because it actually is better quality than the xiaomi...that hinge lol...,1
Lmfao I’ll say better drop prices there are enough of innovations lol,1

Is china true competition?,1
Brand is brand,1

 @Mako K more feature more expensive? stupid logic,0
" @Ben Kem  How is it stupid. Anything with more features (cars, laptop houses) is more expensive since it costs more to make it. And for tech companies it cost more to the research on how to add new features e.g the Samsung hinge. Seems like you have no idea what ""Stupid logic means""",0
" @video clips  cheaper quality hell no, other than that i agree",1
No one will buy a xiamo even if Samsungs doubles their price. Consistency is what matters and Samsung has been at the top for so many years,0

I hate xiaomi so much it just came out of nowhere,0
 @Shiro  That's because it is,1
" @DEADinside RF  Samsung has a marketing advantage. Samsung ADs are literally everywhere regardless of whether it's in the EU or in the US.
Xiaomi spends waaaaaayyyyyy less of their budget on advertisement (generally speaking).
And also, people kinda seem to have a bit worse preconception against Xiaomi exactly because of the MIUI software skin which, from a coding POV is a literal nightmare. I guess Xiaomi phones could perform a lot better and would have a lot better reputation if they'd change to using stock AOSP Android like Xiaomi' Android One series does.",0
" @Mako K  Nope. Samsung is more expensive because of their brand. Samsung is a bigger name with a bigger reputation than Xiaomi. It's the same as buying a cheap shoe VS an expensive shoe. You don't pay for the quality, you pay for the brand.",0
 @Tari Bence  Xiaomi does have some expensive phones since they are expensive to make,0
What about the Huawei Mate XS,0

"Exactly. They are too expensive. Crazy. They beat long lasting reliable, but too much & I wanted the new ones, but just too much. Even their one or so refurbished way too much at $900 not even $500. Ugh. Ypu have to trade in which I don't have option or like to do if I did have one who is tradable,vetc. It's should be $209-$300 with a ax etc as it's old model. They are ridiculous and outrageous.",0
Yea syaomi,1
" @DEADinside RF  Samsung has been established much longer than Xiaomi, and they also have a better rep, even in China. The Western Market hates China brands and exports right now, which is also a valid reason.",0
 @Mohammad Ismail  Are you sure about that? Xiaomi phones are some of the best on the market.,1
Let me know when I can get a xiaomi phone in America.  In the meantime I'll still with my Z Fold.  Can't call it competition if they are not allowed to compete,0

no one can compete with Samsung) even apple uses Samsung chips. GL,0
"lol, how can you say a competition?",1
Well they did invent the screen. It's their tech. But as for making the whole phone. They at least supply people and at a price so they're competitive and drives down price so Samsung good guys here,0
Motorola made a folding phone too.,1
"It's a cool gimmick but what's the advantage from going to a tiny screen to a normal screen instead of from a normal size screen to a huge screen?

Like the Z-flip is way thicker so it won't take less space in your pockets anyways",1
"If you are interested, Huawei made a flip smartphone months ago: The P50 Pocket. There is also the limited edition design with the futuristic (as in avant garde style)designer Iris Van Herpen.
I have been wanting to buy this one maybe in a couple of other months now. The price is high but not obnoxious considering the average price tag of any major smartphone (Even if not Apple or Samsung) so it's ""normal"".",1
" @Leonardo Landi  it actually does. A 6.67"" Phone can fit most pockets but awkwardly. A Flip reduces that to almost half because of the reduction of the length and it's thickness is just like a wallet with cash.",0
" @Jan Saycon  Its honestly sad you had to explain this to him, thanks for doing gods work.",0
" @Jan Saycon  You're right for the mostpart, but I think it's a case much like wireless earbuds where it's not the length/width that counts, but the depth. Because it's so small and fat, it makes a weird protrusion in your pocket. I do think it wouldn't be an actual problem, though.",0
 @Iggys Dinners  thats the thing they need to make it thin and cheap then everyone will use it because rn all these oversized phone are very bad,0
 @Leonardo Landi   I actually use the Z flip 4 and it is incredibly thin. The folds are a bit much but not a gimmick. I'm sure there is a market for it.,1
"Lol it’s not a scam, it makes perfect economic sense. It’s just that since majority of us have so many charging bricks accrued from changing smartphones frequently, it just doesn’t make sense for companies to throw in another one in the box. 

Do note that this trend doesn’t extend to iPads and MacBooks.

If this was in 2010, people would definitely riot given how smartphones are still taking off.
But now in 2022, most of us have smartphones. Why would we need a new charger given how they can pretty much last forever?",0
" @Hetzerogeneous  It does not make sense, you still have to buy a new charger, you're not gonna charge a brand new phone with an old 20w charger. And why still shipping a cable when everybody got 10 at home.",0
" @Hetzerogeneous  I'm not going to charge my brand spanking new phone with some old 10W charger, so obviously i will go ahead and buy a suitable charger for my phone and give them more money.
It's not about saving the environment or some crap, they just saw an opportunity to make more bucks under the facade of saving the environment.
If i am paying a THOUSAND friggin Euros for a phone i damn well better get that charger in the box.",0
" @Stanwine  reason - 💰💰🏦💲🤑🤑
I have absolutely no respect for companies that are in on the no charger included scam and even less respect for the ones which mock other companies for something and then end up doing the exact same thing.",0
"Mix fold2 is  missing some features that I can ignore.
On the otherhand, it is giving some feature which I love: the slimness, the usable size, the fast charging and better Battery. Yet almost 400$ cheaper!!!!
So, overall, I think Xiaomi have done a great job. Congratulations  Xiaomi.",1
" @Stanwine  probably in the west but in the thirld world countries where most people buy/used middle range phone, there’s so many charger already in existence. Also most latest phones are equipped with wireless charging. And most flagship phones charger can be used in the latest model. Also powerbanks are everywhere.",0
 @Abu Hurairah  Idk how exactly reliable are the Xiaomi phones. Chinese brands are suspicious for me. Is the Samsung 23 Ultra next year worth it?,0
" @Lukas Loh  take note the ""no charger included"" only applied to these brands' HIGH END models, so your argument falls flat.

heck, not including chargers would actually make more sense if the lower-ends models got affected, these usually have older charging tech (think old 10w chargers) and normal chargers would suffice, not these high end ones that use a SPECIALIZED charger (specialized = $$$) to quickly charge it",1
 @Basket Case  in third world countries not all people cant afford the high end models. There’s still a percentage of wealthy people who buy this high end phones. So for this high end models to come up with no charger is a great deal for the environment. And i am not that naive that this no charger scheme is actually to lessen the manufacturing cost while still giving consumers high prices for the end product. And im still hoping that the no charger policy will be applied to all kinds of phone.,0
every single phone company did at one point copy the no charger thing including xiaomi,0
" @Lukas Loh  again, your argument falls flat. the fact that very few people buy high end phones in 3rd world countries mean that the environmental benefits of not including them are VERY nil. if they really want to save the environment, they should start with not including accessories for the budget models, which are sold WAY more than flagships, and come with shitty chargers/headphones anyway that they automatically end up as electronic waste the moment the phone is bought.

as is, this is just a scheme to make more money selling separate, expensive, high end chargers.",0
" @Hetzerogeneous  speak from your privilege. For the billions and billions of us in third world countries, one charger per person is still all we got. Sometimes less. Me and my loved ones have definitely been in the situation where we needed to do schedule sharing and whatnot. We do use phones until it's literally falling off by pieces, yes literally. And until those years pass, chargers break or worse. It's 2022 and I still have only one from my Xiaomi that I'm currently using that I got years ago. This is the rule, not the exception. When I went to live in Europe, almost same situation. They'd buy a phone and have that charger brick whether OnePlus or Samsung etc and use it for years and have the one charger. I remember someone took a friend's charger at work and he was pissed it was his only charger for his work phone at his workplace and had to keep borrowing while at work, etc till he was given a new one.",0
"Thing is, they have no choice. They don't have the marketshare or status to not include a charger. They would do the same.",0
"I bought Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 because it had a case and charger included. They actually got my business for that reason, I thought it was robbery that Samsung wanted extra for a charger on a phone costing twice as much.",0
 @Hetzerogeneous  like as if i have a previous phone! Now i have to pay for a charger!,0
"why wouldnt you charge it with an old charger? will that make you look poor? its so strange you guys accept paying high end phones to show how wealthy you are, and then whine because paying 20$ more is a scam! Its silly how you want to appear rich and cry about some charger being out of the box to have a better phone for less price",0
"Imagine you switched from Samsung to Apple, and for ""economic"" reasons they didn't include a charger lol",0
"Do you really think the charger in the Xiaomi box appears from thin air? Of course they will charge extra for it. Not only producing it, but the packaging needs to be bigger which increases shipping cost.
Many people prefer wireless charging which often needs another charger for optimal performance.
And just because your previous charger is a bit slower doesnt render it useless. I dont understand why a phone that lasts a day needs to charge fast anyway. Just charge over night.",0
" @Hetzerogeneous  how many charging bricks do you even have, I have a single USB C one and the rest are older with 5w charging",1
" @Sai  do u know how to read? Did i say something about environment? No, I said is for making the phone cheaper to make and thus expending more on other areas to make it better, because as you should know mobile companies are compiting and need to deliver more for less, they arent all a cult against customers, they have a margin and need to make it happen. And wtf, you paid a premium phone of +1000 dollars and you are poor? If you want whealty people things and whine about 30 dollars, you have economic problems and cant be trusted With money, you get a better phone for less for not including a charger, and fucking cry to not appear poor for using an old charger. And what is worse is that im sure daddy bought it for you",0
" @Leonardo Landi  I have 5 chargers at the moment in working condition, including my ancient 5W apple charger for charging small things like earbuds and mice. I had so many working chargers that I couldn't help but give one to my parents as they are still using an old 12W one.",0
its because (redacted) do not give 2 shits about the environment mate.,1
" @jjk56  Wdym unreliable lol, it's a phone like any other",1
" @Hetzerogeneous  watch mrwhosetheboss' video on this, it is not economically better.",0
" @jjk56  Xiaomi is probably the most reliable chinese brand, I've been using their phones for years and honestly I've never had any issues.",0
" @hello there  yes, they did, but afaik they stopped doing it, it may have been indecisive on their part, but in the end they did better.",0
" @Sun rise  no, they do, they're massive in china, they could easily not include it, hell they didn't include it for a while, but they do again.",0
 @Mind  I wouldn't charge it with an old charger because it slows down charging and wastes more energy.,1
 @Hetzerogeneous  bull i bought 2 more new charger for my 12 cuz Apple changes from USB-A to type-C cable but without a charger,0
" @ABC.U  ok. we hate it, but in the long run, if apple's charger is any good (I assume it is judging from experience), it would last and we wouldn't care.....",1
 @Stanwine  you can still use your old bricks. I have over 5 unused due to this,0
 @Sai  if your spending 1k on a phone you have enough for a brick. If not DONT GET THE PHONE,0
"Bro u fell for the marketing. A good deal for the environment would be eliminating this constant yearly rotation of new phone hardware. Allowing self repair and providing affordable replacement parts for their range of models. Designing hardware in mind with software rollouts that would allow a phone to be continuously used for five years or more and if possible allowing for hardware upgradability to keep up with times if users wanted to stretch further with the phones life. 
Just cutting out the brick is really not as significant for the environment as all the things mentioned above. You're making it easy for them to continue creating ewaste while keeping up the facade that they reducing it as they try to sell you on their latest rotation of phones.",1
" @LittleBigCommentaries  actually, replacement hardware isn’t a popular option for many reasons. Fair phone has strong repairability in mind, but mainly appeals to only a niche crowd.

And regarding the environmental aspect, yes it’s marketing, but there’s actually quite a fair bit of truth, although mostly it has more to do with economics. By removing a brick, you  make the box smaller, making shipping cost much cheaper if you consider how many units you can stuff into the same pallet. Which means more shipping fuel saved per phone. There are other obvious reasons that I won’t go into, but just keep in mind that this backlash will die down and as chargers last, we wouldn’t bat an eye as we switch phones without a charger.",0
+10 social credit points,1
 @Hetzerogeneous  then why don't they exclude the charger price off of a phone?,0
Did i miss something. They removed front camera?,0
" @Hetzerogeneous  It doesn't make sense.
Those cables and bricks tend to die after a certain period of time.
And the user will have to buy another one with it's OWN SEPARATE PACKAGING which makes it the same wasteful, but instead of the company creating the waste, they push it onto the end-user.",0
" @Lukas Loh  The charger of the olders phones are slower chargers.
And a phone that can do a 67W charging just won't be the same with a 18W or a 33W charger.
Also, only the latest flagships are equipped with wireless charging. Wireless charging is not a common practice in mid-range devices. Not to even mention wireless charging being the most wasteful charging form ever because of it losing 2/3 of the possible charge into thin air.",0
" @jjk56  They are pretty reliable.
The software still needs polishing sure, but that can be changed on them without any sort of penalty.
Buying a flagship is also not really worth it. What on earth are you going to use 16GB of RAM in a phone anyways?
I couldn't even max out the RAM usage of my 8GB device even if i opened all the 70 apps i have.",0
" @Basket Case  Mid-range devices get their own charger, even a 33W charger is good enough for most mid-range devices.",1
" @hello there  Yes they did, thankfully they forgot about that joke.",1
" @Tari Bence  from my experience, the cables will naturally die from wear and tear, that’s why companies include it in the box.
But as for Apple’s charging brick, never have I seen any of them dying in my 7 years experience with iOS. They’re tough af compared to other chargers I’ve used including those that shipped with android phones which could barely last 3-4 years.",0
 @Basket Case  Ok then tell me how using all the resources to include chargers for phones that are going to sit around unsold isn't damaging the environment. Samsung used a lot of resources and further destroyed the planet for no reason,0
Imagine buying samsung or iPhone over Xiaomi,1
 @hello there  Xiaomi has always included charger,1
"So far Xiaomi has been a great company in my experience. I had some problems with my Poco F1 and thankfully the seller was willing to take it back and provide an unreasonable refund.

Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Ive had for multiple years now and its still going strong and performing better than every phone people around me are using and it was fairly cheap in comparison.

Cant wait to see what else they come out with.",1
" @Hetzerogeneous  It is a scam, they claim the charger is not included to reduce packaging but packaging has increased as they have to come separately.",0
" @Mind  bruh exactly ! I don’t get it ! You want fold, then sure, but buy the charger too !😂",1
" @Hetzerogeneous  Yeah, it makes sense for the fucking company, not the costumers or their comfort.",1
Why would it be a scam when you have 10 charging bricks laying around?? It's a scam to include one,0

I'd love to have a modern phone with an E-Ink as the outside or backside screen for always on infomations - like a clock, notifications, graphics or using it in bright sunlight.",1

Its not water proof is it?,0
Please be noted that xiamoi didnt inovate it by their selves mi.mix fold 2 doesnt mean tgey did a great job it means they dont have ethic and just make a replica and change a little bit so the process went faster and even they screwed it up,0
They started 2 years later so they can copy. 🤷🏽‍♂️,1

coz' chinese brands are common COPY :D,1
 @deal influence  actually the original folding phone was introduced by a chinese company only. Royale. Search for it. And there's no such thing like copying in tech geez. It's just about making it better. Then even apple copied 120hz display right?,1
leave 2004 behind.,0

Samsung dont push too max because he dont need it. Brcause he only one who sells folds. Do thats why it is what you see,1

" @TOM  irony is that you're calling me noob lmao. All the patents were already owned by royale but the fact the phone was only china exclusive. That's why it never got the recognition outside mainland china. Royale flexpai was released in Jan 2018 and first galaxy fold was released in sep 2019. So they didn't ""just"" released phone before samsung lol. So you better do some research before lecturing others XD.",0

yeah but they're support and products will never be the quality of Samsung,0
"Mix fold2 is  missing some features that I can ignore.
On the otherhand, it is giving some feature which I love: the slimness, the usable size, the fast charging and better Battery. Yet almost 400$ cheaper!!!!
So, overall, I think Xiaomi have done a great job. Congratulations  Xiaomi.",1
But they can't steal Samsung's unbreakable technology that gives a better protection from drops and ip rating,1
 @deal influence  well hope to see your comment when Apple will release their foldable,1
durability with that hinge will be bad,1
 @shorebreak69  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 funny shit ever heard,1
" @AiBi  yeah, hilarious.",1
"And then comes Apple and makes the PERFECT foldable phone, leaving both in the dust. LOL",1
 @Jessica Lee  you are a reasonable chinese i appreciate it. admitting that samsung is the pioneer in that field. chinese companies are important because competiton drives progress,1
 @Jk  Thank you for your reasonable talking.,1
"​ @Jessica Lee  I also agree that samsung need such competitors to make better development, but I can't agree at disgusting words that embellish STEAL and COPY as ""Business strategy"". Let's be honest. If you are Chinese, you know better about what Chinese companies usually do, Aren't you?",1
Hey het me up I have something for you,1
Really no bias? Everytime i come across his videos it's always supposed to be a review of a phone which always turns out a comparison to samsung phones lol. And guess what? Samsung always wins🤣,0

"Foldables seem tempting for me as well, but I just can't justify giving up Apple's integrity when multitasking and working between devices compared to Android. I have various devices, both on Android, Windows and Apple systems, but really, I haven't found anything that can provide me with efficient workflow besides Apple. Which is the stopping factor for me when using a phone, computer or tablet, because I study and work a lot. I can only see foldables as a good alternative for leisure, and it works wonders for that (especially being able to multitask with a bigger screen), but the premium that's charged for buying a foldable just doesn't justify the leisure factor.",0
"Yes, I agree about the MIUI OS being very annoying.  I have got a POCO phone that runs on MIUI and it is not not a smooth operation.",0
what?? what phones did u have? MIUI is one of the best UI lol...,1
Redmi A1 exists 😂😆🤣,1
"I’ve used mi a1 before, and the software is more cleaner and fells more faster and smoother because its pure android, xiaomi should bring MI A series back",1
 @Andrej Fülöp  false lol,1
 @Andrej Fülöp  miui is kinda terrible tbh it just looks messy,0
 @Jasim Anees Ahamed  they still have phones under the android one program?,0
" @Sai  No, they recently launched an entry level smartphone named Redmi A1 
Basically, its a Helio A22 powered device that runs near stock Android, not MIUI",0
" @Andrej Fülöp  Its a good UI, definitely not the ""best"" UI LOL",1
they need money from advertisement or else how can they sell you ultra cheap phone with good quality. it is how it is. i just hope they give us the option to disable ads like for real in all apps. and all versions of miui offer the same miui experience as they did in china because miui global/ other regions isnt that good.,0
I really like miui? What is the problem with it?,0
" @Jasim Anees Ahamed  
As someone who has to deal with MiUi, I must say it's absolute garbage. I despise my phone because of this crap. I need to buy a new phone and destroy this one so one can ever it again. I hate it. HATE it.",0
MIUI is horrible. I am using a Xiaomi phone and MIUI forced me to use a custom AOSP based ROM.,0
"Another thing i hate about Xiaomi is, that they never invents styles by their own. They copied the IPhone x, apple watch , airpods , Samsung note series (old ones), software like IOS , Samsung foldables etc.",0
 @Hungry ?  What about the og Mix. I think Xioami helped to pave the way for bezel-less phones.,0
" @Africsnail  i never thought about the old mi mixes, i'll take a look at it when im free/interested.",1
 @Folasade Oduja  for me it works and acts the same way from the day i got it,1
 @Permaisura  you can do that lol,1
"Same, I also agree",1
" @Andrej Fülöp  ""best"" lol. I am a xiaomi user, but the only reason i got a xiaomi phone is because i already have an iphone for my daily driver. The smoothness of my xiaomi phone gone just after a month thanks to the amount of craps it came preinstalled with. And the amount of notification based ads i got everyday is so much i always have to press clear all rather than checking 1by1.",0
 @Jasim Anees Ahamed  near stock is far from truth,0
 @Nikoraasu  Proof?,1
 @Amy IsMe  actually you can turn off the ads in setting but yeah still annoying and the only keeping me with xiaomi is the charging speed and they gave charger in the box,0
"I wouldn’t wish MIUI on anyone tbh, I absolutely hate using it on my Xiaomi.",0
i never had any problems with MIUI.,0
" @Folasade Oduja  
And how much that POCO costs?

It may be a consequence of weak hardware rather than bad MIUI",0
Pure is not always good or sufficient to be great,1
" @Andrej Fülöp  miui is the most troublesome OS that most app developers has issue with it, running apps on miui always expects glitch. Happened to me, so frustrating",0

"My Z fold 2 has been my daily driver for almost two years now and it's been fantastic. I dropped it several times without damage to any screen, so I don't know if there really is a cracking issue.",0
 @Nate Thornburg  I feel the exact same way. I really like the Z Fold 4...I just don't have any particular use for it at the moment.,0
Xiaomi use Samsung screen. There's your answer. Tho they don't use ultra thin glass so a bit less issues on that front,0
 @SuperBoop  The moment you OWN IT you figure out what it's useful for. If you love content this phone is a BEAST.,1
"samsung foldables are perfectly reliable lol wtf are you talking about, of course there are a few cases of defects, like literally every other product.",1
Xiaomi buys the screens from samsung anyway bc they dont have the tech for this,0
" @SuperBoop  you think you don't until it gives you all these options! I'm hooked! The first phone to get me on it was the LG V60 dual screen. Which I feel, if LG didn't exit phones, would be on par with the samsung experience.",1
 @DyreVerge  best phone,1
"Try look for jerry rig. Hes testing flip 4 durability, its better than previous generation for sure :)",1

"keep in mind you only hear about the people who suffered screen issues complaining loudly about it and further reinforced by ppl frothing at the chance to jump on reasons to sh!t on foldables since its new tech. You dont get the same emphasis by the majority of owners who are happy with their phone.
as with all new tech. whethr its foldables or electric cars or whatever, people have this expctation that if its not perfect out the gate, then its not worth it
As if the existing tech is perfect without compromises",0

look at the mix fold with its 108mp (25mp) main cam...an all it can do.. try bens gadget reviews or techtablets as  ( unlike some people) they dont advertise for apple an samsung in every vid.....as far as samsungs screens on foldables... if you look at enough vids youll know its crap screen peeling .. the works....,1

 @Forrest O.  kinda cringe,1
 @DyreVerge  would take a nokia over an iphone.,0
thanks for watching the video just like us,1
Doesnt the Samsung one leave a Gap so no Dirt can scratch the Display when getting inside? I only can imagine how the Xiaomi looks after some Months.,0
 @Lukas  Yeah kinda bummed Arun didn't mention this. Well then again Zack from JRE will test it someday.,0
talk about the fold line. I won't get a foldable phone until they deal with that line that's on the screen.,0
 @Lukas  just wipe before you fold if you notice dirt or dust...,1
 @Dee M rick  That's a deal breaker for me as well. I just won't be able to get used to a crease that's right in the middle and ruin your viewing experience.,0
" @Dee M rick  On that one too I think xiaomi is doing a little better than samsung. It's not perfect but like at least they're trying to make it less annoying, while samsung totally gave up on that already. Not even trying to reduce that crease for 4 generations at all...",0
 @Haru Yanto  You will never notice every dirt always and imagine wiping every time you close it.,1
" @Lukas  yeah and there are already stories about the samsung screens after a year of use being pretty weathered, i wonder how this one holds up in the same time frame",1
Exactly,1
he totally forgot the outside screen selfie camera though,0
" @Dimitris Andreou  That's a very good point, so video call has no problem at all!",1
" @T Wang  exactly, and it isn't uncomfortable to take selfies either like he says",0
I feel like a lot of people have forgotten how good Huawei's foldable (the Xs at least) was tbh. Like its biggest weakness was having a screen everywhere which meant that you had to be careful but it's still to this day one of the best foldable imo (RIP Huawei),0
" @Gaiiden  I agree. Huawei's foldable (one of the inward folding model) was the first one that actually made me want to buy because of the same reason that it works just like a normal phone when folded, unlike a TV remote or something. It was the price that stopped me tho...",0
" @Dee M rick  I've had the fold 4 for about 2 weeks and you never notice the crease when using the phone. If you're looking straight at phone and with any tilt that runs in the same direction of the crease, it's invisible. You only start to see the crease when you tilt it about 45 degrees from your line of sight. So if you look at it like you would any other phone, you would never see it while using it",1
" @T Wang  but they did though, the crease is less prominent on the fold 4 compared to earlier folds",0
" @Jake Darkside  Hmm ok maybe they tried, but I checked it in a local shop and it's still too much for me",0
 @T Wang  tina wang?,1
 @Jockuptown  Hmm nope. Wang is an extremely popular name so you are not finding someone you know :),1
Finally someone names current shortcomings of this form factor sincerely. I really cannot justify switching to the Fold from my S22 Ultra how ever I wish I could.,0
"Mix fold2 is  missing some features that I can ignore.
On the otherhand, it is giving some feature which I love: the slimness, the usable size, the fast charging and better Battery. Yet almost 400$ cheaper!!!!
So, overall, I think Xiaomi have done a great job. Congratulations  Xiaomi.",1
"i went with the z fold 4 for the waterproof and software. also camera is much better. would love it to be lighter and slimmer, but yeah, I'll wait for the next gen and make the swap",1
"I like that the Fold 4 is more narrow when folded, that's the point, it ""one-handable"". Then when you want a big screen you unfold and thre it is! I think making the phone that big when folded defeats the purpose",1
I love how the thumbnail itself answers the title,1
"Excellent review. I think that huawei has by far the best foldables, but due to the camera qualities and the price tag compared to the classic ones, it's better to go for a mate 50 pro and enjoying it 4 or 5 years before the foldable become more accessible.",1
"About the thing closing flat: this is a disadvantage for EDC use. Smallest things like dust, crumbs, sand or anything on the screen gets pressed into it. These foldable screens are very sensitive, it could easily get scatched, dented or really damaged. I very much prefer the Samsung wedge design for this reason.",0
"I am 100% with you on the folding phones mot being the most practical of ideas yet, by that i mean the sandung fold not the flip. I just want the flip phones to get better because they have a practical and a more generalised use as opposed to the fold phones which is like a foldable tablet.",0
"I've been using my Xiaomi phone for 4 years and I have 0 complaints. It has oled, full screen (zero bezels via pop up camera) and it was like 500 dollars.",1
"I was just having a conversation with my brother about Samsung's and Xiaomi's foldable phones, this is insane timing! Very excited to watch, here we go.",1
"Been waiting for this phone all year, so very excited to see it in all it's glory.
 
Looks like Xiaomi really nailed this one",1
"I always prefered Huaweis version of the foldable, they already did everything better than Samsung in the foldable terrain and Xiaomi just took a good portion and added google services. So hopefully we will see the Mate X3 this year",1
"The thicker size seems pretty good for my caveman hands. I would really like to see things taken to a triple folding accordion screen so that third screen has a usefulness in achieving a close to 16:9 tablet ratio.

really the main thing preventing the adoption of folding screens isn't the features at this point but the cost is just way too high",0
"You nailed the problem with this form factor. To much redundant staff that you probably wont used most of the time resulting an increase of unnecessary cost. I still prefer Huawei XS series form factor which fold outward. Though I understand the concern with regards to durability especially with the screen however, this form factor is far easier to scale down which have fewer cameras and screens. Making it more accessible to the general market.",0
"I've switched from Samsung to Xiaomi a while back and I don't regret it. I've gotten what I wanted for less. 
Now with folding phones, I'm not a fan. They look cool but there's just too many problems with them. No matter the brand I would probably never get a folding phone. If I want a bigger screen I'd rather just have a tablet or a laptop.",0
I didnt get a samsung fold until the 2 when i knew it would be much better and now I traded that in for the 4 I love the form factor and the new features. I look forward to seeing what the Z Fold 6 brings.,1
"I took my jump pretty recently from an s20+ to this fold 4, and I've been loving it. But like he said, it's a niche thing that not everyone will enjoy on a day to day basis. Make sure you like holding a small tablet on repeat before getting one of these!",1
"That's true, the current generation of foldable phones are inefficient compared to normal phones, but if you love the idea of foldable phones then I think it's good. Also, I've been watching kdramas and they're mostly using samsung fold and flip phones, and I can say that they really do look good and eye-catching.",1
Nice! I wonder how Samsung will step up with its next model,1

Copies were always has been cheaper my guy.,1
 @Hungry ?  Yes but better and also cheaper copies are rare trust me,1
 @Just green  it doesn't feels a premium feel to me using a cheap copy of the original one. Plus Samsung's one ui is the best software in the world. & Samsung's display is always more vibrant than any other devices.,1
" @Hungry ?  If its better than the original why shouldn't it feel premium? Xiaomi uses similar/same display panels that are better color calibrated.
Also i think the Miui is probably the best Android skin ever if it wasnt for the bugs and this fold version is almost bug-free so you should probably make research before speaking :p",1
 @Hungry ?  A slimmer phone doesn't feel premium to you but a wobbly brick does? Sounds like biased fangirling to me..,0
 @Just green  copy is copy. It doesn't feels premium in the mind. For an example will u have the same impressions with the fake air pods instead of the original air pods ?,1

" @Hungry ?  It isn’t a copy, the physical form is different. Samsung copied Apple anyway.",0

" @Hungry ?  If the copy one is better than the original i will have better impression because i also spent less money on it, even if its better",1
" @Michael Minx  all xiaomi phones are really water resistant, if you watch teardown videos you will see that the xiaomi has a water seal even on the sim card tray, the ip certificaton is just a plus",1
"2000$ iphones for example have ip68 certificatons but a friend of mine held it between his wet swimming suit and the face id no longer works, my xiaomi fell straight up into a swimming pool and still works perfectly without any ip rating",0
 @Just green  its ur opinion ive nothing to do abt it. But xiaomi & oppo needs to stop copying things without any limit. Xiaomi is ok but oppo is a major copy cat.,0
" @Just green  yeah, but water resistant foldable mechanism is a little different to putting a rubber bend on the sim card trey on noal phones..",1

 @admxr  no I wouldn't because I wouldn't waste my money on a phone with a crease for the same price could get a much better spec'd out phone than you know your only selling point an extra screen that's basically turning the phone to the smallest tablet (I buy a tablet because they are BIG) WITH A BIG CREASE DOWN THE MIDDLE,1

is a total

" @Tristan the vr gamecat  bruh 70€/month is nothing, i waste more than that a month on much more stupid things",0
" @Tristan the vr gamecat  you mention the price is a negative but lemme tell you, for many of the people buying this phone (myself included) money isn't a factor. We can afford to switch to any phone we want. It's a cool toy. It doesn't have to be the best phone for everyone, just for it's target market.",1
 @Daniel Parr  omg you pay £1500 ouch,0
 @Tristan the vr gamecat  yeah thats why I couldnt overpay for such a phone,1
" @Chris723  baring in mind the phone costs nearly £300 more outright, I've got it cheaper with a contract and gifts for free essentially",1
 @Daniel Parr  I didnt even know it was so expenssive I taught it was in the 1200-1300£ range. Yeah it was a good deal and got the contract out of it.,1
 @Chris723  normally ee take the piss but the trade in deal this year was brilliant. Bought a burnt and bent s10 on ebay for £40 and gave them that lol f ee,0
How much money did u lose buying and selling that fold?,0
 @Fyn Kozari  same as any other phone two years later,1
 @Tristan the vr gamecat  I have used the fold and you only see crease in certain angles. Like opposite to the light source and that light source striking in the center. You just don't feel that when you aren't touching it. Don't scream just by looking at YT videos. I mean atleast they did something and it will improve.,0
" @Daniel Parr  Yes as I said it is only visible in certain angles that are really easy to avoid. And like about the iPhone 4's connectivity problem like Steve said ""Just avoid holding it like that"" 😂. And in the food's case it's easier to avoid. Much easier.",1
" @Tristan the vr gamecat  Many people use their phones for every thing. It's different than carrying a phone and a tablet. It's like carrying a small tablet but somehow in your pockets! Well you don't want then don't get. But many people would definitely be impressed by it. I tried it but I will go for it when it has a better camera and aspect ratio! Like the Vivo fold was the best if you don't consider the weight. It didn't even had a crease. But Samsung's UI is really good for multitasking. Split screen and floating windows work like a charm. You get Sd8+gen1 and a full day battery! With a bigger display. If you are not heavy camera centric, it is better to buy fold. Why hate them for trying something. If they hadn't tried, you would have still be using a nokia 3310! In a few years they will perfect it..",0

"I own the 1st version and tried out the 2nd. Both are nice feeling, the 2nd feels ahead of the competition.

What I will say is that the OS long term is unbearable. I wouldn't go ahead with their 2nd version unless I could just get normal Android. Apps constantly closing or not sending notifications due to permissions that can't be edited fully.

I did manage to download pretty much all of the Google services (background processes and apps) that aren't included with the OS, including Play store. It ""works"" but I can't get over the UX mentioned above.

Great for content consumption, after over a year I still can't see the crease much when actually watching stuff, but I might even go back to my old Note 9 just to actually use as a phone as these don't work as a power user.",0
The concept of going through through the history of a product and seeing the evolution is so fun!!. I've been waiting this time to see the Xiaomi Fold. Arun has improved to another level. Kudos to Arun,1
Finally someone who mentions how much studier the Z fold hinge is and how well flex mode works. The best thing about these Chinese foldables is the outer screen though. They really should release the Mi fold world wide to give Samsung competition.,1
I really like what Xioami did here and that is not just because I use their phones for the past 4 years. Foldables are absolutely not for me and I would not ever use them. But this. this did caught my eye...,0
"I think the real game changers are Apple who are rooting back to mini phones, I have never been more happier to own a mini but power loaded phone which can do all flagship tasks easily",0
I think you managed to cover all the goods and bads of foldable tech in a small comparison video. great video.,1
I've come to really love Xaiomi products over the years. It's just a shame they have this weird distribution setup whereby some of their products are not sold to the west but you can buy them on most Chinese global commerce sites.,0
Fold form factor is nice but I feel like there's a next gen answer that I can't really imagine yet. I'm hoping more competition pushes us toward that next generation faster,1
"It's always nice to see direct competition like this, the consumer always wins in that regard.",1
The hinge was my favourite point. The full-folding hinge should also be implemented on Samsung phone,1
This looks really good. I wish I cared about this foldable trend. Maybe I will revisit once the initial conceptual hurdles get sussed out.,1
Great review again Arun. Good to hear a honest and simple opinion on foldables from you.,1
"I think samsung would have made it thinner but not yet for reasons they know best. Xiaomi is not water resistant as far as I know. I have fold 4 and it is excellent. A bit heavy but it feels solid. And the flex mode is great. So I don't see xiaomi as best foldable if it can't do a lot, just because it is thinnest. So if slimmest is the threshold, perhaps. But it lacks what makes it practically sturdy use, it isn't a good phone. I personally do think fold 4 is thick but I'd rather sturdy than flimsy.",1
"Super excited for this one! Btw, I loved your video on the Pixel 6 Pro and Z Flip 4. I'm now a proud owner of both of them, loving it!",1
I'm hoping for a proper Flip competitor. The moment that crease is confirmed to last longer than three years I am definitely copping one.,1
"I am visually impaired and the only reason I have not switched to a foldable yet is because of the inside screen being rather soft, that's a big problem, small bumps or even nail scratches would be the end of the device in my case. Which is disheartening, it would be such an awesome upgrade!",0
YES I was waiting for other manufactures to make their own and make the market for foldables cheaper and better.,1
"Finally!!! You rock man☺️

I truly prefer the Mix Fold 2... In everyway...

On a sad note... I wasn't aware of the awkward movie ratio thing.

Your reviews are always very informative.... Although in this case, too informative 🥲.

On a lighter note, I would purchase the Mix Fold 2 in a heartbeat, if only I could comfortably afford one 😂.

Beautiful! Beautiful review as always Arun.",1
"As soon as flip/slide phones turned into smart phones the foldable/slidable feature just became an unmanagable obstacle. It will always have more problems than advantages (vulnerability, parts that can break, higher battery consumption, less space for hardware, size, prize, etc.)
If you really need a phone with a big screen, just get an additional tablet for the occasion, the prize for both combined is probably similar",1
Gonna buy the z flip next month. I've started using my phone less and less. And I belive that  the z flip will help even more with it. Appreciate you putting these two next to each other. Helped me choose the flip 😂,1

Fold it into a pair of VR and/or AR glasses.,1
If you fold a paper side by side 42 times it will reach the moon...maybe that's a place to start for the next gens!,1
Rollables are the answer,1
"Rollable phones are the next thing... Seriously, I probably won't change my current S22 ultra until Samsung makes a good rollable phone. Everything else has drawbacks that aren't worth switching OR they don't make as huge an impact like a rollable phone would make",0
" @Resonance Hub  That's why I bought an S22 Ultra too. It's a true flagship for specs, better than the Fold's downgraded specs. And it's an actual phone, plus the S-pen is cool. Big enough screen for a power-user too",1
"Going faster means more mistakes, i'd rather they took their time and maybe launch a fold device every two years.",0
" @Carlos Leyva  Not when it's a company. Competition means more investment, and more effort. AND a better end-product, because they're trying to beat the others. Fierce competition is GREAT for consumers!",1
" @Adam Greenhill  Agree about the S22, but the Fold does have a better chip. Not all downgraded.",0

Hello Let talk(i have something for you) 🎁,1
"I love the wider front screen, really makes it more usable, but the lack of a stylus defeats the purpose for me. It would be perfect for something like taking notes in class and studying on the go with that tablet sized screen and then a normal phone for everyday use. Even the cost makes sense when you factor in specs and having to buy a tablet instead. So close, yet so far...",0
"Foldable market would be incredibly exciting if everything came to an international level. I'd say general experience and reliability would be better on samsung, but otherwise, the competition gives them a good run for their money. On the google case for the mi fold I think it is purely because of china things, since other xiaomis don't have this issue, the part of some annoying manufacturer apps is a bit shit on them, general software experience for me is nice, clean, not too much of a hog, though sometimes a bit unresponsive. Design is so puch nicer then samsung, actually looks interesting and clean, not just prototype boring look. Also getting everything in the box is just bonus points, and wireless charging is a gimmick, still not efficient especially with current energy problems. Overall a decent foldable, mostly just depends on your needs.",1
I love your videos because you always say the good stuff about it and then tell us the things that would change our decision. Like little things some of us wouldn’t notice until we try them,1
"What happened to rollable phones? I think they would be much better since they have just one screen expanding, unstead of 2 Screens.",0
It's great to have an old school phone review again! Love the video 😉,1
4:40 I really like MIUI but those are really the issue for me. That's why I switched phone brand to Infinix with XOS which is kinda not good as MIUI but I don't have those limitations from MIUI with it,0
"The z flip is just so aesthetically perfect, so i would choose it, but hopefully this competition will improve the performance.",1
"I use the Microsoft Duo, cuz it was cheap at the time cuz it was a flop literally XD but still I like my flip like a book phone, I use it the most time to read or play old Gameboy or NDS games. The only problem with duo is as u've said about all flip phones, that flip phones doesn't withstand the durability test for a daily usage. Exactly, that's also the problem with duo XD but I don't see them as normal phones, more as a tablet that can be used as a phone. That's only what I refer for general flip phones and why I'm so interested in them. Is cuz, I like to have a tablet with me... But I don't want it to be so big that it won't fit in my bag. Sometimes I want to just go jogging and still have my work in a smaller version on my side. Instead of bringing a Laptop with me.",0
"The soft screen is what put me really off when I tried the z fold once in a store. I don't know if it is something that will ever be able to be fixed but it's just weird feeling like i'm touching soft plastic instead of a glass screen, it feels like it's going to be damaged if I press it with even a mild force. The dip right over the seam is also very off putting, and in this video I can see that is still a very big problem in this model as well.",0
I only had one xiaomi but they include case and standardized the 4000mAh battery for a couple of years including budget phones.,0
I think its a miss. But there are enough  interesting features   to want to  see what Xiaomi release as their Flip competitor,0
"I love the idea of the foldable phones with 2 screens, but I still think they need work and really nail the market. I shall stick with my Xiaomi poco x3 pro and my Xiaomi mi pad 5 until I decide I want a phone that's a combination of a phone and a tablet but fantastic video as always!",1
"I mean both Huawei and xiaomi foldable looked fine off the box before as well.
The issue that always came after a month or two was the durability of the phone because of the sacrifices they made to make it look like they beat samsung.
Also that internal crease actually looks very clear and visible even on recording like this, which means it's prob worse irl.",0
"Arun, honestly as much hype there is on Foldables.  Iam not blown away with the Foldables.....But you know whats good. Your reviews... keep innovating thumbs 👍 to you and the Team",1
As a fold 4 owner I can tell that this video is spot on,1
I love my Fold 4. I'm forever a fan of giant displays now and am eagerly awaiting the Samsung Flex series,1
"Well to me if I were to use one, will mainly be the open/undolded for browsing, gaming, watching videos. The rest of the functions such as calls, messaging, video calls will fall on the closed/folded form. As for the photo taking, I guess can go either way.

As far as I see it, the target audience may not be everyone. Eventually getting there, for know I view it as a luxury. It will not be common yet unless the cost will be managable.",0
Cool video! Key take away for me was new foldable phones still have that obnoxious crease in the middle. I'm fine waiting a decade for Apple to perfect the foldable functionality and sacrifice and organ or two to get it.,1
"I absolutely love how you built it up all so high and mighty.

Only to then bring it crashing back down to earth with the harsh realities of what makes acquiring a phone especially of that size and price point in 2022 where in my opinion personally the Cons outweigh the Pros however each to their own.

What you've essentially done Arun is perform a Claude Littner on this video and I absolutely love it!",1
"I think the 'not fully folding' hinge might be an advantage for Samsung, as it protects the very inner edge of the soft foldable screen. 
At the very center, the most force is exerted (each side acts as a lever) and grit in the center can get squashed in the xiomi, whereas Samsung let's it fall out",1
"Can't believe it's 2022 and we don't have proper alternatives to Samsung's S Pen for other phones, it's such a good feature and almost a decade old!",0
 @Sankhyo Halder  cant see myself using a stylus on a phone lol 😂,0
 @Jonas  Fold is a tablet,1
"I get what you’re saying as using it as both a phone and a tablet, I actually never considered that that may be why people want it. Imagine having an iPad and iPhone all in one (or a tablet and phone), that would be pretty cool. I carry my iPad with me and my iPhone everywhere, so I don’t relate really to wanting them together, but that’s just because I’ve never considered it.",1
" @Jonas  Depends on the use case, i bought a note 10 lite, just to see if i would actually use it and for me, being able to physically write notes within 5 seconds is really useful to me.",1
"I'm better than Mrwhosetheboss, My content is better!",1
"I think if your using it for notes in school , college , university then be better off with a dedicated tablet screen size can be much larger and just seems more practical (you don't have your phone out in class with the distractions) and alot more tablets have pen options , better speakers etc I dunno seems like people just making excuses for wasting money on a phone with a crease",1

 @Moayad  you dont have to watch the videos though,0
 @DeadlyCreeperH  Thanks for the reminder,1
"It's always relative to price. If it's priced the same as a normal flagship it will sell like hotcakes, despite the drawbacks. Interestingly the China price for the Mix Fold 2 (9000 CNY) is the same as the iPhone 14 Pro Max.",1
"Thanks for watching I appreciate 🙌
Tell Meeka i referred you for something new 🆕",1
"One thing Z Fold 4 surprises me is it feels so comfortable and delightful to hold, its thickness and weight feels right. Here's why. As you are holding a light and slim candybar phone, you are more of squeezing its weight between your palm and fingers. The Fold 4, you can comfortable let the weight land on your fingers, and its hinge width makes it feel very secure in your hands.",1
"For now, of all foldables (dual or triple screens) phones surface duo makes the most sense.",1
"As someone who just bought the fold 4, I'm extremely happy that there is now solid competition. This should ensure that my upgrade in 2-3 years should be that much better",1
"The floating window seems to b e a recent trend for chinese UI, huawei had it last year and while it works it makes stacking 2 apps a lot longer than just holding a contextual button or the square if you are using navigation buttons.",1
"Amazing, I like the idea of foldable smartphones. they are so easy to store and give you so much screen space. Normal phones don't have that. It is a pleasure to see that samsung is not the only one creating good foldable smartphones. It really brings back that original blackberry flipphone aesthetic that no one really gets anymore these day's. I also hope that Apple would make a foldable iphone. It would truly be a sight to see. I also realise that smart glasses might be the future and that foldable smartphones won't be needed. What are other peoples opinions? reply below ⬇",1
"I've been using the device for the past 10 days. Chrome installation works fine, battery life is excellent and MIUI experience a bit buggy. I am sure it will get better due time.",1
Hardware wise the Xiaomi is everything I want. Hope Samsung will learn from this,0
"The Xiami looks bigger when folded. My big issue with the Fold 4 was it is a tiny phone, when folded, for my hands.",0
Can we appreciate the fact that he managed to rick roll us in a foldable phone review,1
"Xiaomi really needs to release all their phones to the global market not just in China. I wanna buy a new phone for my partner, but their 12S or pros ultras only exclusive in china , without a global MIUI ROM their phones are lame in Google apps. And the Redmi K50 series are so tempting too.",0
"I finally got a foldable device, the fold 4 after thinking it has so many downsides. I heard again and again that golden up, it's too big to hold, and unfolded it's too wide to type. 
I feel like it's a phone made for my giant proportions and feels just right",0
Your way of reviewing the tech is just on another level. Truely amazing.,1
"The problem for the Mix Fold 2, which I'm using right now, is simply software support. Not exactly from Xiaomi, but from other companies. 
For example, gboard with a split layout is now purely limited to the samsung z fold series. Fix that, google, there are more foldables in the market now, do something.",0
That phone looks really nice. This is what the ZFold 4 should have looked like.,0
"Great vid, love the presentation! Want the most productive foldable? Microsoft Surface Duo 2. Every bit as thin at the Xiaomi but the two-screen setup is just designed to run multiple apps; I wouldn't want to go back to my Pixel after having my SD2 for a couple months.",1
"I was literally about to switch from iPhone since the 3Gs to buy the new Xiaomi. 
But thanks I saw your video, now I am willing to wait more before changing !

💯👍",0
Huawei Mate XS2 has the best form factor on a foldable at the moment. Very user friendly and the case in the box makes it convenient to carry around without worrying about scratching the display. It has a dedicated selfie camera as well as rear cameras and a rear screen that can be used to take selfies/make video calls,0
"For the Xiaomi foldable, I felt like the hole punch was a missed opportunity. If they removed it and just use the rear facing camera as the selfie cam, then boom, Xperia is gone",0
Man this foldable form factor in smartphones strikes so much resemblance with ev vehicles like its a loss in the long run kinda thing and Arun's last line about not jumping into it righnow also seems applicable. Amazing Video though,0

I agree,1
"Just sounds like people spending alot for worse specs and only having a crease in they screen to show for it it's like having a phone with the worst tablet attached , I'd much rather just have a better tablet at that point",0
 @Tristan the vr gamecat  and Android doesn't offer too much for a tablet experience.,0
A foldable phone can have better specs tham a regular phone. It just has not happened yet. I think foldable phones are cool and I hope Apple makes one. Apple would not make a worse foldable phone. It would be the best foldable phone.,0
"The things causing me to sit on the fence in regard to foldables are thickness, price and teething problems. I still love the Fold concept, and this device is a huge step in the right direction. I will stay with the traditional flagships for now, but it is highly likely that I will go for a foldable in a few years, when the technology is mature enough.",1
Tbh I still don't see the point of getting a fold over an ultra model even if you have big hands.,0
" @Amit Keni  it's the ""tablet"" part",1

"Nobody thought the nokia 3310 was bulky. It's just by making comparisons that people comment that it s too thick.

"The XS & XS2 outward fold are absolutely the best foldables by a long way because they use the simplest solution which always wins the game.

They did the inward folding X2 just to show Samsung how inward should be done but they knew the future is outward folding.",0
I do think it's the best form factor but the safety and exposed screen is a big concern since it's not even glass,0
"But, same with most other folds out there it doesn't made it to global market. Which is such a shame to look at",0
With the worst battery life in foldables.,0
" @ZAds Azhad  the protective case that you get in the box covers the back screen when folded, it also flips open to allow the phone to stand horizontally and also makes it easy to carry",1
" @X Y O N  I get just over a day using it and it's my main phone, I wish it could last 2 days honestly but 66W charging makes it worthwhile",1
 @X Y O N .?? Amazing battery life,1
" @ZAds Azhad 
Why would you want glass on ANY phone.... Glass was always a stupid idea",0
 @pachy444  since when foldable plastic is better than glass? It's scratches easily and even weaker than glass. How tf you gonna use the screen if it's not glass,1
 @pachy444  then stick to buying plastic budget phones then,0
"Nah, my zfold 4 is 100% advantages",1
"I think a slid and raise device is much better. Remember the old kjam? If the second screen slides out and raises to the same height as the first screen using a two step hinge it will be much more usable but also, much more expensive.",1
It's closer in thickness to a normal phone than the Samsung fold is to it. Thats pretty crazy.,1
"That MIUI fold is impressive, the fact that they take their time to make its own dedicated software",1
Xaiomi's Mix line up is always unique and fantastic,1
Maybe after a year or 2 we will get the global market versions of this from xaomi and have a whole lot more features to experience like horizontal app layouts and what not,1
"Amazing overall video
And the last advice were perfect for people who are like myself looking at the market from a distance",1
I wish foldable phones had a aspect ratio closer to a regular phone on the inner screen so when watching movies or any content it takes full advantage of its larger screen. Great vid as always,0
"To be more fair, Fold4 is 13.2mm to 15.8mm thin. And with multiple discount from Samsung, you can get Fold4 (512g) +case with spen+ Watch5 pro + Buds2 pro by $1300 after tax, which is cheaper than Mix fold2 alone.",1
This looks like the future. I was convinced foldables were just a fad but this changed my mind. It obviously needs improvements but this is a great proof of concept.,1
Glad to see there's actual competition for the Z fold now. I'm just looking forward to when Apple join the race too. Maybe in the next...5 years?,1
The thickness is not a big problem for me cause I always hold my phone in my hands I don't put it in my pockets but for me to get one of these folding phones they need to at least be durable to my nails so when I turn the phone around for a better selfie or Idk anything else I don't want to accidentaly scratch the screen (what am about to say may not apply to everyone) Ive always used a samsung note phone and that stylus has become a part of me and remembering the leaks from past years am hoping with the note's dissapearance they will forge the note and the fold togheter even tho the last S ultra phone was basiclly a Note in disguse 🤞,0
"I think Xiaomi is just so much better than most other phones out there. Their UI is great, they're powerful, they charge fast and often at a cheaper price. The only thing keeping it back is that most of their phones aren't available on the western market and so their google services are bad. I have a mi mix 4 and i had to download chrome by APK and it's really bad with notifications from apps like Snapchat, Facebook or Instagram.",0
"Even though I'm not a apple fan, I feel like the moment apple enters this foldable space, everything will change since they'd optimize their software.",0
"I use a xiaomi myself, and I can say that the power button fingerprint thing I both like and dislike. Sometimes I just look at my lock screen for the time, but to turn it off again I have to double tap, because as soon as I touch the button the thing unlocks. But it's also nice that it's in a familiar place and I don't need to get used to putting my finger somewhere else as a previously fingerprint-reader-less phone user.",1
I made the jump from 13 pro max to fold 4. Had a couple of weeks with it now I absolutely love it. Battery is a bit poor compared to my iPhone but I do use the fold a lot more then I did the iPhone,0
So grateful and proud of Xiaomi!,1
Im looking forward to see big phones get wider again. 21:9 is great and all but it still feels like somewhere closer to 16:9 I'd prefer.,1
"im so glad for this device, that will only make samsung come out with an even BETTER foldable, super excited to see what they come out with in the next few years",1
Please release this in the UK. It's what Foldables should've always been. I'd even make do with losing out on OneUI.,0

"God I wish these were sold at us carriers, would love being able to trade in my 13 pro max towards this and get a great deal",0
"Just got my z fold 4 the other week, my first folding phone. I must say I'm absolutely blown away by the efficiency, productivity, etc that it brings. I will NEVER be going back to a regular slab/candy bar phone. 10/10 for the z fold 4!",1
"ONE OF THE BEST THING ABOUT DUDE IS THAT HE NEVER TAKES CREDIT FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE ACHIEVED SOMETHING. HE ALWAYS REGULAR US. THE AUDIENCE HIS TEAM, AND HE IS POLITE IN ALL HIS VIDEO. WE CONGRATULATIET OURSELVES ON THIS ACHIEVEMENT. MORE TO COME🥰🎯💞💓",1
"Still a dangerously small folding radius for the display, which breaks lots of Samsung screens. Is it intended? Like... planned obsolescence after maybe just a year?

I own the Motorola Razr 5G and its folding mechanism is outstanding. It surely takes up a lot of space inside the casing, but after two years of medium-excessive use (20-40 foldings per day) I can identify just a soft wave on the display. The phone has several other downsides, of course, but at least the very reason I bought it for works perfectly.
I hope, other manufacturers might consider using this concept too...",1
I have the fold 4 and it's pretty amazing IMO.  But that looks awesome too.,1
"They can add smaller spring mechanism under the screen to parlellise the screen 
So that if fold and unfold they can retain their original position with spring mechanism
It can withdrawn longterm usage",0
"The design is much neater, but how does Xiaomi's after-sales support compare with Samsung? My Fold3 had to go back for repair a week out of warranty and Samsung arranged for a courier to pick it up the day after I DMd them on Twitter.",0
"I love the consistency and the Quality of your content Arun, never stop these reviews, keep it up!!! LOVE from Canada!!",1
"Hopefully Xiaomi comes with a flip. I wasn't a fan of the Samsung Fold, but the Mix Fold is absolutely beautiful.",1
"I just had my Z Fold arrive on my doorstep today. It's still in the box. Watching the first part of your video I was thinking I just made a huge mistake.  🤣 
Thankful I was the way to the end. Great video!",1
"I was strongly considering the Fold 4, not anymore!",0
Solution for the selfie camera issue would be integrating a popout camera on the other half of the screen that way no matter what the selfie camera would be facing you no matter the screen mode (open or closed),0
My wife and I just upgraded to new phones ( haven't upgraded since out galaxy s5 active phones). The wife picked out the z flip 4 and I choose the z fold 4. Both phones are perfect. I needed something small but could become bigger like a small tablet while my wife wanted something small to fit in her jacket pocket but she doesn't need the mini tablet size. Have been using them both now for 2 months and honestly couldn't ask for better phones. So sick of seeing every new model of phone that came out looking like the last model with only a Lil bit better options.  I saw the flip and fold phones that came out years ago and thought it was a great idea but the technology wasn't up to par at that time. They drastically improved the design and functionality as well as durability is up there now. Only gripe I have is the high price right now.,0
"Right on! I love the dimensions of the Xiaomi. I wish Samsung made theirs that size and thickness. At the same time, the second part of the video I couldn't agree with more! I tried a foldable for a few months and just wasn't for me... Maybe when the form factor and thickness is better, I'll give them another try.",1
This looks amazing! Can't wait to try it out 💫,1
